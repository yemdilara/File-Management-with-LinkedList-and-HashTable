# File Management with LinkedList and HashTable

## Project Description
This project aims to develop an application that processes data read from a file using LinkedList and HashTable data structures. It allows for the efficient management of student information, including adding, updating, and deleting records while ensuring that changes are written back to the original file.

## Tasks
- **Reading from File:** Initially, read data containing student information from a file and store it in both a LinkedList and a HashTable.
- **Writing to File:** Whenever a new student is added or an existing student's information is updated, the changes are written back to the same file.
- **Delete and Update:** Update or delete student information and ensure the file reflects these changes after each modification.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Data Structures:** LinkedList and HashTable for storing student information
- **File Handling:** Used to read and write student data to and from a file
